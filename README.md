# COPIES
COPIES is a computational pipeline for identification of CRISPR-facilitated integration sites. Designed to work for any organism with a genome in NCBI and for any CRISPR system, COPIES can identify safe harbors/neutral sites in a genome-wide manner. The identified sites can be used for synthetic biology toolkit characterization and construction of genetically stable strains for biochemical production.
